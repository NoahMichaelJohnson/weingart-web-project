                    <h2>Childhood</h2>
                </header>
                <p>Born in February, Wolfgang Weingart lived near Lake Constance, in the southernmost part of Germany close to the Swiss border. He believed early years of life are incredibly valuable as they are made of “the dreams and feelings only a child can experience”. He grew up during World War II in a time of bomb shelters, allied attacks and food shortages. Weingart began primary school late in 1947 where he discovered the discontent he felt toward schooling. He hated grades, report cards, exams, being called on my teachers, French and German, math, physics and especially chemistry.</p>
                <p>At an early age his ingenuity wasn’t to go unnoticed. He used a small hand drill to create holes of various sizes in his school desk and placed his textbooks underneath to read the answers during exams. He sites both his suffering in school and his poor fit with rural life as being responsible for his independence at an early age. His wont to create and tinker by hand led him to a profound childhood discovery: “intellect can be expressed and cultivated through handwork.” His real discovery came after crashing his beloved “Göppel” bicycle into a wire fence. While untangling the bike from the bent wire he saw the shape of a house, motorbike and landscape appear in the lengths of wire. Through this he realized his affinity for abstraction. He became aware of his interest in visual design.</p>

                        Beginnings
                    </h2>
                </header>
                <p>In the late 1960s after Weingart’s visual talent had started to be recognized by his teachers, he interviewed at and then enrolled in Merz Academy, a reputable arts academy in Stuttgart, Germany. At seventeen he began a two-year course in applied art and design. His time at Merz Academy heightened his technical knowledge, and the hands-off approach to instruction furthered Weingart’s independent sensibilities. With the intention of learning a trade related to graphic design, Weingart began a typesetting internship at Ruwe Printing in Stuttgart, that he would remain at for the next three years. This was his first true breakthrough in design. His introduction to Swiss typography inspired and enlivened his years spent as an apprentice.</p>
                <p>At the start of Weingart’s internship he met one of Armin Hofmann’s first students, Karl-August Hanke. Hanks became Weingart’s mentor, serving as a teacher of how to rationally define the abstract principles of typography and design that inspired Weingart, but confused him. Hanks was adamant about Weingart discontinuing his internship with Ruwe as he thought the German way of design that was taught there was outdated and had not shown progress in decades. Having already signed the contract, Weingart was locked into the internship. Still, Hanke strongly encouraged him to enroll at Basel School of Design to study their new Swiss style of design.</p>
                <p>It was during this time as an apprentice at Ruwe that Weingart developed a mastery of the letterpress. He spent countless hours, days and months experimenting with not only his assignments but the letterforms themselves, and the intricate, and to him, fascinating relationships they had with the paper. He’s said what captivated him the most is how a blank page turns into a printed one. He was constantly torn between the inherent constraint of typography and the spontaneity of his other work in linocut, woodcut and pencil drawings.

            <p>On the twenty-second of March, 1963, Weingart went to Basel to meet Armin Hofmann and immediately applied as a student for the following year.</p>
            <p>From 1966 to 1968 he worked as a part-time assistant setting type at a printing firm in Basel. The years he spent working and living in Basel were a time of personal change for Weingart. Not counting on being offered a teaching job at the Basel School of Design, he could only think about how Swiss typography would and could ever change. He knew he wanted to adopt a new, novel form of typography with his traditional skills, but he didn’t know what it would be.</p>

            </header>
            <p>Towards the end of 1968 schools for the arts were losing funding, and student protests raised the topic of professor’s credentials not being what they should. Weingart saw the flyers and posters that emerged from the underground rebellion. These flyers had messy, snipped-out and pasted typography that signaled to him a new, fresh style was being created.</p>
            <p>Weingart began to feel “everything that made me curious was forbidden— to question established typographic practice, change the rules, and reevaluate its potential.”[03] This began Weingart’s intense focus on novel uses of traditional and Swiss typography practices and was responsible for the creation of New Wave, a style of design that would not only rocket Weingart to international fame, but live on in popularity for decades to come.</p>
            <div>
                <p>Weingart began teaching at Basel, and broke new ground in the educational field. He spent the next fifty years lecturing and teaching in many countries around the world such as New Zealand, Australia, Asia, Europe and North and South America. In 2013, his great strides in the exploration and teaching of design were recognized by receiving the AIGA medal, the highest honor of the design profession.</p>
